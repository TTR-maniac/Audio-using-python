This is a Audio Book I made myself using pyttsx



# hHow do I change it to say whata I want?


Good Question but fist please read my book it took me a long time to writ
to change it find the 
"engine.say" thing and you will se next to it there is a "('')" With a bunch of words well thats my book then just.
delete that and write whatever you want but FIRST
PIP INSTALL IT BY WRITING THIS IN YOUR TERMINAL
pip install pyttsx3
